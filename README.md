Now you will have a copy of the repository in your own GitHub account.

Before continuing, please ensure you have downloaded the right version of git for your computer.

[Download Git Here](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

Afterwards, open the Git Bash in a folder of your choice on your computer.

- **Windows:** Open folder in explorer > Right click anywhere within the folder > Show more options > Git Bash here

- **Mac:** Open Folder in Finder > Control-click the path bar > Open a new window > Choose Open in Terminal

Use `Git clone <your repository url>` to clone the repository.

If everything went according to plan, you will have a copy of the repository on your computer which includes this README.md file. Next, create a `filename.txt` file within the folder and save it.

By opening the git bash/ terminal again, you can use `git commit -m 'your commit comment'` and `git push` to upload your code to GitHub.

If you refresh the GitHub website of your repository, the `filename.txt` file created earlier locally on your computer should appear in the web interface of GitHub.

Once we confirmed everything works well, take about three minutes to write a small poem, song text, or any story that comes up to your mind.

Use `Control + Shift + M` to toggle the tab key moving focus. Alternatively, use `Esc` then `Tab` to move to the next interactive element on the page.
