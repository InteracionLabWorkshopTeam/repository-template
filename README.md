# This is a template repository

The first step will be to clone this template repository. Do so by clicking **Use Template** in the top right corner and follow the instructions. Make sure to make the repository public. This will help us to collaborate later on.

Now you will have a copy of the repository in your own GitHub account.

Before continuing, please ensure you have downloaded the right version of git for your computer.

[Download Git Here](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

Afterwards, open the Git Bash in a folder of your choice on your computer.

- **Windows:** Open folder in explorer > Right click anywhere within the folder > Show more options > Git Bash here

- **Mac:** Open Folder in Finder > Control-click the path bar > Open a new window > Choose Open in Terminal

Use `Git clone <your repository url>` to clone the repository.

If everything went according to plan, you will have a copy of the repository on your computer which includes this README.md file. Next, create a `filename.txt` file within the folder and save it.

By opening the git bash/ terminal again, you can use `git commit -m 'your commit comment'` and `git push` to upload your code to GitHub.

If you refresh the GitHub website of your repository, the `filename.txt` file created earlier locally on your computer should appear in the web interface of GitHub.

Once we confirmed everything works well, take about three minutes to write a small poem, song text, or any story that comes up to your mind. And do not worry about spelling mistakes, we have a solution for that later on.

In the next step we are going to create our first branch. Find yourself in pairs of 2/3 people and grant each other access to your repository. Therefore, click on Settings > Collaborators and Teams > Add People to add each other. Make sure to grant write access to your fellow contributors.
